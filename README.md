Short 1-2 sentence summary

	This code is a start to automating the processing of LiDAR data collected during my masters research.

Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)

	Objective: Start with a raw .las file output from the DJI TERRA software and produce:
		classification of ground and canopy points, production of digital models: ground surface, canopy height, canopy cover, etc.

Datasets you will use (with links, if available)

	UAS datasets collected with the UO DJI L1 LiDAR sensor.

Python packages that team members require


	libraries:
	os
	whitebox
	laspy
	open3d
	numpy

	

Planned methods/approach

	Established methods on github and other repositories.

Expected outcomes
	
	See objective section.
